# 2022 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Analysis 

This is a repo for a 2022 course at the Department of Cosmic Research, MSU. 
The course covers the very basic concepts of ML, it is obligatory for 4th year students, and for MS students it is an elective course.

# General info
- The course consists of 12 lectures and 12 seminars and 5 homeworks.
- All lectures and seminars will be held **online** via Zoom and probably recorded (Zoom screen capture).
- PDFs with lecture slides will be published here: https://disk.yandex.ru/d/ftlAXAWOxYqxnw
- All homeworks are to be submitted **online**.

**!!There will be no exams, final mark is based on homeworks only!!**
